# Spinal Epidural Abscess (SEA)

**Classic triad** (back pain + fever + neuro deficits) found in only 2-13% of SEA pts. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15028325),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21417700)

## ESR test

- If ESR >20, sensitivity=90% [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15028325).
- If ESR >30, sensitivity=81% [2].

## Diagnostic Guideline

## Study design

- Prospective cohort analysis of clinical decision guidelines to diagnose SEA 
- n = 86 patients (55 in 9-year control group, 31 in 5-year study group)

## Outcome measures

1. Diagnostic delays (multiple ED visits or admission to nonsurgical service without diagnosis of SEA
2. Presence of motor deficits at time of diagnosis

## Risk factors for SEA used in this study

- Diabetes
- IVDU history
- Chronic liver or kidney disease
- Recent spine procedure
- Indwelling spinal hardware
- Recent spine fracture
- Indwelling vascular catheter
- Immunocompromised
- Other site of infection

## Limitation

1/3 of physicians did NOT follow guidelines with &ge;1 risk factor esp in setting of trauma and non-midline spine pain

## Results 

- **Diagnostic delays:** 84% without guidelines, 10% with guidelines (OR = 48)
- **Motor deficits at diagnosis:** 82% without guidelines, 19% with guidelines (OR = 19)
- **ESR:** Sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 67% if &ge;1 SEA risk factor
- **ROC curve** better with ESR (0.96) than CRP (0.81)
