# Tranexamic Acid (TXA)

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic form of lysine, an amino acid. It binds to receptors on plasmin preventing it from breaking down fibrin clots. The drug has been studied in many settings for the prevention or treatment of hemorrhage. The uses most relevant to emergency medicine (EM) include traumatic hemorrhage, gynecological hemorrhage, and epistaxis, summarized below. 

Please note that the vast majority of these indications are not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

## Dosing

### FDA Approved

**Menorrhagia**: brandname Lysteda, 1,300 mg PO TID during menses, max 5 days

### Off Label Dosing

**ENT**

- Epistaxis treatment using injectable form of TXA topically [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911102)
- 500 mg in 5 ml of TXA soaked into a cotton pledget was superior to anterior nasal packing
- Absolute risk reduction 40%, NNT 2.5
- Small study, only 216 patients

**OB/Gyn**

- Postpartum hemorrhage: 1,000 mg IV over 10 minutes given within 3 hours of vaginal birth or cesarean section
- If bleeding continues after 30 minutes or restarts within 24 hours after the first dose, a second dose of 1,000 mg may be given [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5446563/)

**Trauma**

- Trauma-associated hemorrhage: IV Loading dose 1,000 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 1,000 mg over the next 8 hours [[3]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20554319)
