# Atrial Fibrillation and Anticoagulation

## Background

**Atrial Fibrillation** (AF) = **5x** risk for CVA and increases with age 

- Patients with persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should be treated the same when it comes to deciding about anticoagulation. They have an equivalent risk of stroke.

**Stroke risk factors for patients with AF:**

- Prior CVA or TIA
- HTN
- Age &ge;75
- CHF
- Poor LV function
- DM

## CHADS2 stroke risk stratification scheme 

- **C** = Congestive heart failure (1 pt)
- **H** = Hypertension (1 pt)
- **A** = Age &ge; 75 (1 pt)
- **D** = DM (1 pt)
- **S2** = prior Stroke or TIA (2 pts)

## Deciding on whether to anticoagulate with aspirin or warfarin: ([AHA/ACC/ESC 2006 guidelines](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/114/7/e257.full))

### Weak Risk Factors

- Female gender    
- Age 65-74 years        
- Coronary artery disease               
- Thyrotoxicosis

**Treatment**

- <span class="drug">Aspirin</span> or <span class="drug">warfarin</span>

### Moderate Risk Factors

- Age >75 years          
- Hypertension                     
- Heart failure           
- LV ejection fracture &le;35%              
- Diabetes mellitus 

**Treatment**

- 1 risk factor: <span class="drug">aspirin</span> or <span class="drug">warfarin</span>
- &gt;1 risk factor: <span class="drug">warfarin</span>

### High Risk Factors

- Prior CVA        
- Prior TIA         
- Embolism          
- Mitral stenosis   
- Mechanical heart valve

**Treatment**

- <span class="drug">Warfarin</span>

## Notes

- Anticoagulation goal with <span class="drug">warfarin</span>: INR 2-3
- If age &lt;60 years AND zero risk factors: No anticoagulation because low risk for CVA
