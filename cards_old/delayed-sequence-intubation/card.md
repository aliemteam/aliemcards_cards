# Delayed Sequence Intubation (DSI)

**General Concepts**

- DSI is procedural sedation/dissociation where the procedure is preoxygenation
- Breaks up the sequence of RSI to preoxygenate prior to paralysis—prolongs safe apnea duration and decreases risk of gastric insufflation or aspiration
- Maintains patient’s spontaneous respirations and reflexes

## Candidates for DSI

- Agitated due to EtOH, head injury, or psychosis, but with normal lungs
- Agitated, but with lungs capable of being oxygenated on non-rebreather (NRB) mask: hypoxic due to COPD, pneumonia, ARDS
- Agitated, but require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to preoxygenate
- Unobtainable or unacceptable vital signs due to any of the above
- Need to perform a procedure that the patient is not tolerating prior to intubation (e.g. NGT placement prior to intubation of GI bleeder)

## Ketamine

- **Dose:** 1 mg/kg IV push (may need to re-dose 0.5 mg/kg to maintain dissociation)
- **Pros:** 30 sec onset, achieves dissociative state, maintains spontaneous respirations and airway reflexes, maintains hemodynamic stability
- **Cons**: May increase intracranial pressure in patients with high MAP, may cause laryngospasm, use with caution in patients with CAD, HTN, or tachycardia

## Equipment and Troubleshooting

- Respiratory therapist
- Nasal cannula (NC)
- Non-rebreather (NRB) mask
- Bag valve mask (BVM) with PEEP valve
- 2 O2 flow meters (NRB or BVM, NC)
- Ventilator with NIPPV settings
- Non-vented mask with straps for CPAP
- End tidal CO2 monitor

## Pearls: DSI ≠ NIV 

- Preoxygenation may be achieved with NC, NRB mask, **OR** NIPPV, depending on the patient’s needs
- If your patient is not agitated, NIV may be sufficient without the need for sedation/dissociation
- Intubation may be avoided if adequate dissociation and oxygenation is attained

## Delayed Sequence Intubation (DSI) algorithm

**Note:** During CPAP or BMV, it may take several minutes (may be as long as 10 minutes) to bring the oxygen saturation > 95%, while increasing PEEP up to 15 cm H2O.
