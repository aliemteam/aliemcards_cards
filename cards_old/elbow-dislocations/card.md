# Elbow Injuries: Elbow Dislocation

![Anterior vs posterior elbow dislocation drawing. 90% are posterior](image-1.png)

## X-ray views

- AP Elbow
- Lateral

## Acute Management

If Simple Posterior Dislocation
- Closed reduction
- Observe post reduction for delayed signs of vascular or compartment syndrome
- Long arm posterior splint with elbow in 90 degree flexion

## Follow Up Timing

Admission
- Vascular Injury
- Open Dislocation
- Unable to successfully close reduce the elbow

Urgent (<3 days)
- Especially for complex dislocation, anterior dislocation or peripheral nerve injury

Less Urgent (< 7 days)
- For simple posterior dislocations without neurovascular compromise
- 1 week of immobilization with early range of motion exercises

## Notes

Classification:
- Simple: No associated fracture
- Complex: Associated with elbow fracture (1/3 of elbow dislocations)

Terrible Triad:
- Elbow Dislocation
- Coronoid process fracture
- Radial head fracture

Complications:
- Ulnar nerve neuropraxia (14%)
- Median nerve and brachial artery injuries (more common with anterior and open dislocations)
- Compartment syndrome
