# Cervical Spine Rules

The National Emergency X-radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and Canadian C-spine Rules (CCR) are both validated studies which both quote a high sensitivity (over 99%) in detecting clinically significant cervical spine fractures. Both studies primarily used plain films in evaluating their patients.

| Study                      | Sensitivity | Specificity |
| -------------------------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| **NEXUS**                  |    99.6%    |    12.6%    |
| **Canadian C-spine Rules** |    99.4%    |    45.1%    |

## NEXUS study 

A patient's neck can be clinically cleared safely without radiographic imaging if all five low-risk conditions are met:

1. No posterior midline neck pain or tenderness 
2. No focal neurologic deficit
3. Normal level of alertness
4. No evidence of intoxication
5. No clinically apparent, painful distracting injury

## Canadian C-spine Rules (CCR)

The basic approach in the flowchart: 

1. Make sure that the patient meets the eligibility requirements as in the CCR study. 
2. Determine if there are high-risk findings. If so, go directly to imaging.
3. If there are no high-risk findings, check to see if the patient qualifies as a low-risk candidate where you might be able to clinically clear the c-spine without imaging.
4. If the patient is neither high or low risk, then the patient is moderate risk and requires imaging.
