# Knee Injuries: Knee Dislocation

![Posterior vs anterior knee dislocation drawing](image-1.png)

## X-ray Views

### AP view

- Look especially for small avulsions, such as a Segond fracture, which is a lateral tibial condyle avulsion fracture

### Lateral view

- Look for symmetric or irregular joint space

## Acute Management

**_Orthopedic vascular emergency!_**

- Reduce knee and re-examine neurovascular status
- Consult vascular surgery for hard signs of vascular injury

Measure the Ankle-Brachial index(ABIs):
- ABI &ge; 0.9: Monitor by serial exam
- ABI &lt; 0.9: Obtain CT angiography

Splint knee in 20-30 degrees of flexion

## Follow-Up Timing

Hospital admission required for serial neurovascular exams and consideration for surgical stabilization

## Notes

**Dimple sign** 
- Buttonholing of medial femoral condyle through medial capsule
- Suggests irreducible posterolateral dislocation

**Associated findings with knee dislocations**

- Popliteal artery injury (18%)
- Common peroneal nerve injury (25%) â€“ check for foot dorsiflexion weakness and numbness to dorsal foot
- Ligament tears
