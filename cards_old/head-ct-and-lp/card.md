# Head CT: When unnecessary before LP for meningitis

**Caveat**: This review only applies to those patients in whom you suspect meningitis. This does not apply to those being worked up for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

If **ZERO** of the following high risk features, it is safe to do LP without a Head CT.

| **High Risk Features Associated With An Abnormal CT**      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Age &ge;60 yr                                              |

| History of CNS disease (mass lesion, CVA, focal infection) |
| Seizure &lt; 1 week prior to arrival                       |
| Altered level of consciousness                             |

| Abnormal visual fields                                     |
| Facial palsy                                               |
| Arm or leg drift                                           |

## Study: [Hasbun et al. NEMJ, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11742046)

**Design:** Prospective observational single-site study (n = 301)

**Observed results**: 

- 235/301 underwent head CT
  - 56/235 (24%) had abnormal CT
    - 11/56 had mass effect

**Validation arm: Applying the “high risk” criteria back to the enrollment group:**

- 235/301 underwent head  
  - 96/235 (41%) had no “high risk” features 
    - 93/96 (97%) had a normal CT
      - 3/96 (3%) had 2 non-herniations and 1 mild herniation on CT
      - All 3 patients underwent LP without complications.

**Results: Time savings for who did not undergo CT imaging (CT-)**

- Time to antibiotics (3.8 hr for CT+ vs 2.9 hr for CT-) 
- Time to LP (5.3 hr for CT+ vs 3.0 hr for CT-)

**Limitations**

- Study requires validation on a separate population, different from the derivation group 

**Conclusion**

- If there are no abnormal “high risk” clinical features, you can safely perform a LP without a CT to assess for meningitis (NPV = 97%) 
- Skipping the head CT prior to LP decreases time-to-antibiotics and time-to-LP
