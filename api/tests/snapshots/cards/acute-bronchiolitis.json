Obtain patient's medical history\n2. Complete physical exam with vital signs and pulse oximetry\n3. Assess hydration status\n\n## Assess Severity\n\nAssess severity by considering:\n\n- Any history of apnea\n- Respiratory rate\n- Work of breathing\n- Mental status\n- Pulse oximetry\n- Ability to feed/drink\n\n> Routine chest xray, viral testing, and blood or urine testing are **NOT** recommended\n> The above diagnostic testing **MAY** be considered in the case of severe or atypical presentation or if concern for congenital or acquired heart disease\n\n## First Line Therapies\n\n- May consider supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> > 90%\n- Consider nasal suctioning (if signs of nasal congestion)\n- Maintain hydration status (if needed via IV or nasogastric feedings)\n\n## If Patient is stable and/or improving\n\nDischarge home if patient meets following criteria.\n\n### Discharge Criteria (must meet all requirements)\n\n1.
