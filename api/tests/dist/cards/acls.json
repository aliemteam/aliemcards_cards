This puts it at roughly a q4 minute dosing (recommended q3-5 minutes).\n- Don't delay CPR when you recognize a cardiac arrest. That means do this first, and then work on giving oxygen, placing the patient on various monitors, setting up the defibrillator, and establishing IV/IO access. Hence, the C-A-B mnemonic (Circulation before Airway)\n- Chest compressions should be \"hard and fast\" -- Depth of at least 2 inches and &ge; 100 compressions with a target PCO<sub>2</sub> on the end-tidal capnography of &ge;10 mm Hg.\n- Use your mobile phone's timer to help alert you every time when 2 minutes is up.\n\n## Additional reversible causes\n\n**(not listed on ACLS AHA guidelines)**\n\n- Hypoglycemia\n- Trauma\n\n## Return of Spontaneous Circulation\n\n- Pulse and blood pressure\n- PETCO<sub>2</sub> abruptly sustained increase (typically &ge; 40 mm Hg)\n\n## Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\n\n**Ventillation & Oxygenation**: \n\n- Start at 10 breaths per minute\n- Titrate to target PCO<sub>2</sub> 30-40 mm Hg\n- Titrate FIO<sub>2</sub> to minimum necessary to achieve SpO<sub>2</sub> &ge; 94%\n\n**Treat Hypotension**\n\n- IV/IO bolus: 1-2L normal saline or lactate \n- Vasopressor infusion as needed:\n  - <span class=\"drug\">Epinepherine IV</span> 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg per minute\n  - <span class=\"drug\">Dopamine IV</span> 5-10 mcg/kg per minute\n  - <span class=\"drug\">Norepihephrine IV</span> 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg per minute\n\n**Evaluate Need for Coronary Catheterization**\n\n- 12-Lead ECG STEMI or high suspicion of acute myocardial infarction? Proceed to coronary reperfusion.\n\n**Targeted Temperature Management**\n\n- If no meaningful response to verbal stimuli, maintain a constant temperature between 32°C and 36°C \n\n## Patwari Academy video tutorials\n\n- [ACLS: Airway](https://www.aliem.com/2012/patwari-academy-videos-acls-and-airway/)\n\n## References\n\n- Neumar RW, Shuster M, Callaway CW, et al.
