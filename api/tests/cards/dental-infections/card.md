# Dental Infections

- **Dental caries** - demineralization of protective enamel and subsequent tooth decay
- **Pulpitis** - inflammation of pulp secondary to caries
- **Periodontitis** - loss of supportive bone structure caused by chronic gingivitis

## Periapical Abscess

Collection of purulent material at apex of tooth

- Secondary to bacterial invasion from carious destruction of enamel
- History: Progressive pain, thermal sensitivity
- Exam: Caries, decayed tooth, pain with percussion, palpation of apex, gingival swelling, erythema, parulis present, mobile tooth
- Treatment:

- Antibiotics

  - Uncomplicated: <span class="drug">Penicillin</span> or <span class="drug">Clindamycin</span>
  - Complicated: <span class="drug">Penicillin</span> + <span class="drug">Metronidazole</span>, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, **or** <span class="drug">Clindamycin</span> + <span class="drug">Ceftriaxone</span>

- Pain control
- I+D if abscess present: probe with 18g needle → purulent → 11 blade stab incision → hemostat blunt dissection +/- packing
- <span class="drug">Chlorhexidine</span> 0.1% rinses q2-3h if I & D
- Surgical referral, if complicated infection (Ludwig's, Lemierre's Syndrome)

- Dentist followup:

- Uncomplicated: Generalist in 1-2 days
- Complicated: Oral Surgery as soon as possible

## Periodontal Abscess

- Localized purulent infection within the gingival wall of the periodontal pocket
- History: Swelling, pain, loose tooth
- Exam: Purulent discharge, erythema, fluctuant mass, dental extrusion
- Treatment:

- Pain Control: Dental block, NSAID’s +/- opioids
- I & D abscess as needed: 11 blade stab incision → hemostat blunt dissection +/- packing
- Antibiotics:

  - <span class="drug">Penicillin</span> or <span class="drug">Clindamycin</span>
  - <span class="drug">Chlorhexidine</span> 0.1% rinses q2-3h

- Dentist followup
- Generalist in 1-2 days

## Pericoronitis

- Inflammation +/- infection surrounding impacted or partially erupted tooth
- History: Usually 3rd molar (wisdom tooth), erupting teeth, pain, swelling, halitosis
- Exam: Erythema, swelling, +/- abscess
- Treatment: Same as for Periodontal Abscess

  - Pain Control: Dental block, NSAID’s +/- opioids
  - I & D abscess as needed: 11 blade stab incision → hemostat blunt dissection +/- packing
  - Antibiotics:

    - <span class="drug">Penicillin</span> or <span class="drug">Clindamycin</span>
    - <span class="drug">Chlorhexidine</span> 0.1% rinses q2-3h

- Dentist followup: 
- Generalist in 1-2 days

- Definitive treatment: Oral Surgery
