# TPA: Code Dose of TPA

**Clinical Question:** In the rare situation where fibrinolytics may be indicated in cardiac arrest from PE or Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), what’s the dose?

**Take Home Points**

- The dose of <span class="drug">tPA</span> in cardiac arrest is somewhere between **50-100 mg** given as a bolus +/- infusion.
- According to the [2010 AHA Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S729.full), “Ongoing CPR is not an absolute contraindication for fibrinolysis.”
- Some studies suggest allowing 15 minutes of CPR for drug to work.
- Evidence is ‘best’ for PE; data does not support for undifferentiated cardiac arrest.
- Anticoagulants, such as heparin, were used in most studies along with the fibrinolytic.
