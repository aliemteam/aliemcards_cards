N/V associated with CP\n4. Pain with exertion\n\n**Clinical factors that DECREASE likelihood of ACS/AMI:**\nChest pain that is:\n\n1. Pleuritic\n2. Positional\n3. Sharp, stabbing\n4. Reproducible with palpation\n\n## Severity of pain is not related to likelihood of AMI at presentation, or composite end points (death, revascularization, or AMI) at 30 days\n\n[Edwards et al., 2011]((http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802776))\n\n**Objective:** \n\n- Determine any correlation between severity of CP and the risk of AMI at presentation, or composite end points (death, revascularization, or acute myocardial infarction) at 30 days\n- Severe CP was defined as 9–10 on a 10-point pain scale. \n\n**Results:** (n=3,306)\n\n- Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 1–8 (82% of patients) = 3.0%\n- Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 9–10 (18% of patients) = 3.9%\n- Not statistically significant different\n\n## Many “atypical” symptoms are more likely to render the diagnosis of ACS than traditional “typical” symptoms \n\n[Body et al., 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036454)\n\n**Objective:** \n\n- Assess the value of individual symptoms for predicting a diagnosis of AMI or the occurrence of adverse events (death, AMI, revascularization via PCI or CABG) within 6 months\n\n**Results:** (n=796)\n\n- Strongest positive predictor of AMI: \n- Diaphoresis with CP\n- Other positive predictors of AMI and adverse events\n- Nausea and vomiting with CP\n- CP with radiation to both shoulders > right shoulder > left shoulder\n- Central chest pain\n- Strongest negative predictor of AMI\n- Pain located in the left anterior chest\n- Other negative predictors of AMI and adverse events\n- CP described as pain being the same as previous AMI\n- Presence of CP at rest\n\n## No characteristics of CP alone, or in combination, identify a group of patients that can be safely discharge home without further diagnostic testing\n\n[Swap et al., 2006](%20http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16304077)\n\n**Objective:** In a literature review (1970-2005), identify the elements of a CP history that might be most helpful to the clinician in identifying ACS.\n\n**CP characteristics that INCREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**\n\n| Characteristic                   | # of Patients  |  LR |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------: | --: |\n| Radiating to both shoulders/arms |            893 | 4.1 |\n| Radiating to right shoulder      |            770 | 4.7 |\n| Pain precipitated with exertion  |            893 | 2.4 |\n| Pain associated with diaphoresis |          8,426 | 2.0 |\n\n**CP characteristics that DECREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**\n\n|  Characteristic                | # of Patients   | LR  |\n| ------------------------------ | --------------: | --: |\n| Pain that is sharp/stabbing    |           1,088 | 0.3 |\n| Pleuritic pain                 |           8,822 | 0.2 |\n| Positional pain                |           8,330 | 0.3 |\n| Pain reproducible by palpation |           8,822 | 0.3 |\n\n**NOTE:** Beware the chest pain which radiates to the RIGHT shoulder (LR = 4.7).\n\n## Clinical features have a limited role in triage decision-making for ACS/AMI\n\n[Goodacre et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11874776)\n\n**Study Design:** Prospective, observation cohort study \n\n**Objective:** Assess the performance of clinical features used in the diagnosis of CP, specifically in patients who were clinically stable and had a non-diagnostic ECG.\n\n**Results:** (n=893)\n\n-  Predictive of ACS/AMI:\n  - Exertional pain\n  - Pain radiating to both arms > right arm\n-  NOT predictive of ACS/AMI: \n  - Presence of chest wall tenderness\n  - Nausea or vomiting\n  - Diaphoresis\n\n## History alone can help, but can NOT rule out ACS/AMI! \n\n[Panju et al., 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786377)\n\n**Objective:** To identify clinical features that would increase or decrease the probability of an AMI, presenting with acute CP through a literature review (1980-1991).\n\n**Features that INCREASE the probability of an AMI**\n\n|  Clinical Feature                          | LR  |\n| ------------------------------------------ | --: |\n| Chest pain that radiates to both arms      | 7.1 |\n| Chest pain that radiates to right shoulder | 2.9 |\n\n**Features that DECREASE the probability of an AMI**\n\n|  Clinical Feature                    |  LR |\n| ------------------------------------ | --: |\n| Pleuritic chest pain                 | 0.2 |\n| Chest pain that is sharp or stabbing | 0.3 |\n| Positional chest pain                | 0.3 |\n| Chest pain reproduced by palpation   | 0.3 |\n\n## References\n\n- M.
