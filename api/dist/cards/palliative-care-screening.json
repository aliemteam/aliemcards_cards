It can be delivered concurrently with curative care. Early identification of patients who are likely to benefit is key.\n\n## Determine if your patient could benefit from Palliative Care consultation\n\n### STEP 1\nDetermine if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness:\n\n1. **Advanced Dementia or CNS Disease** (e.g. CVA, ALS, Parkinson's): Assistance needed for most self-care (e.g. ambulation, toileting) and/or minimally verbal\n2. **Advanced Cancer**: Metastatic or locally aggressive disease\n3. **End Stage Renal Disease**: On dialysis or serum creatinine >6 mg/dL\n4. **Advanced COPD**: Continuous home O2 or chronic dyspnea at rest\n5. **Advanced Heart Failure**: Chronic dyspnea, chest pain, or fatigue with minimal activity or rest\n6. **End Stage Liver Disease**: History of recurrent ascites, GI bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy\n7. **Septic Shock**: Requires ICU admission AND has significant pre-existing comorbid illness\n8. **High Chance of Accelerated Death**: Provider discretion – e.g.: Hip fracture in age >80, major trauma in elderly (multiple rib fractures, intracranial hemorrhage), advanced AIDS\n\n### STEP 2 (Consultation)\nConsider a Palliative Care consultation if your patient has at least 1 life-limiting illness (above) AND 1 or more of the following:\n\n1. **Frequent visits**: 2 or more ED visits or hospitalizations in the past 6 months\n2. **Uncontrolled symptoms**: Visit prompted by uncontrolled symptom (e.g. pain, dyspnea, depression, fatigue)\n3. **Functional decline**: Examples - Loss of mobility, frequent falls, decreased oral intake, skin breakdown\n4. **Uncertainty/distress**: Caregiver cannot meet long-term needs; Uncertainty or distress about goals-of-care\n5. **“Surprise” question**: You wouldn’t be surprised if the patient died within 12 months\n\n## Symptom Control: Improve quality of life in the ED\n\n| **Symptom** | **Interventions to Consider**                         |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| Agitation   | Haloperidol                                           |\n| Anxiety     | Lorazepam or diazepam                                 |\n| Dyspnea     | Supplemental O2 and/or morphine for comfort           |\n| Pain        | Standing morphine or fentanyl, or use of opioid drips |\n\n## References\n\n- George N, Barrett N, Mcpeake L, Goett R, Anderson K, Baird J.
