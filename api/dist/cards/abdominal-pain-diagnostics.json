No need to order routinely. If you are worried about a perforated viscus, order an upright chest x-ray instead -- more accurate and less radiation. \n\nObtain plain film if suspicious for:\n\n- Pneumoperitoneum (although upright CXR is better)\n- Small bowel obstruction (where CT not readily available) \n- Localization of foreign body ingestion or catheter\n\n**Abdominal/Pelvis CT**\n\n- Median radiation dose = 15-31 mSv (CXR has 0.1 mSv dose.)\n- Oral contrast likely does NOT provide more information in acute abdominal pain. Known 241-minute delay.\n\n**Ultrasound**\n\n- Increasing use of bedside U/S for point of care testing in EDs.\n- _Advantage_: can be used for unstable patients, no radiation exposure \n\n## Lactate\n\nLactate is useful adjunct to risk stratify for mortality ([Shapiro et al. (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855951))\n\n| Lactate | Level (mmol/L) | 28-day in-hospital mortality | Early death (≤ 3d) |\n| ------- | -------------: | ---------------------------: | -----------------: |\n| Low     |        &lt;2.5 |                         4.9% |               1.5% |\n| Medium  |       2.5-3.99 |                         9.0% |               4.5% |\n| High    |             ≥4 |                        28.4% |              22.4% |\n\n## Diseases\n\n**Appendicitis**: CT is first-line, unless pediatric or pregnant patient. Then U/S is first line. MRI is an alternative to avoid CT radiation risk.\n\n**Cholecystitis**: Normal LFTs do NOT rule it out. LFT's helpful as adjunct to determine likelihood for common bile duct stone.\n\n**Diverticular disease**: Prevalence &lt;5% (age&lt;40 yrs), 30% (age 41-60 yrs), 65% (age 61-85 yrs)\n\n**Ectopic pregnancy**: Discriminatory zone for gestational sac is B-HCG ≥6,500 (transabdominal U/S) or B-HCG ≥1,500 (transvaginal U/S).\n\n**Mesenteric ischemia** of concern because of subtleties in presentation.\n\n- **Multidetector CT angiography with reformats**: sens 96%, spec 94%\n- **MR angiography**: Sensitivity 85-90% (SMA), 75-90% (celiac artery), 25% (IMA) \n\n**Nephrolithiasis**:\n\n- **Microscopic hematuria:** sens 89%, spec 29%\n\n**Pancreatitis**: Lipase (sens 90%, spec 93%) is better than amylase (sens 79%, spec 93%). Unlike level of elevated enzymes, CT correlates with severity.\n\n**UTI**: Urine dipstick alone is adequately predictive, except for children, elderly, suspected urosepsis.\n\n- **Nitrites:** Odds Ratio (OR) = 6.36\n- **Leukocyte esterase:** OR = 4.52 \n- **Blood:** OR = 2.23\n\n**LUQ Pain:** Limited use for labs/imaging, unless elderly, immunosuppressed, or trauma patient\n\n## References\n\n- Shapiro NI, Howell MD, Talmor D, Nathanson LA, Lisbon A, Wolfe RE, Weiss JW.Serum lactate as a predictor of mortality in emergency department patients with infection.
