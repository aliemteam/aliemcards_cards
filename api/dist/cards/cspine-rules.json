Both studies primarily used plain films in evaluating their patients.\n\n| Study                      | Sensitivity | Specificity |\n| -------------------------- | :---------: | :---------: |\n| **NEXUS**                  |    99.6%    |    12.6%    |\n| **Canadian C-spine Rules** |    99.4%    |    45.1%    |\n\n## NEXUS study \n\nA patient's neck can be clinically cleared safely without radiographic imaging if all five low-risk conditions are met:\n\n1. No posterior midline neck pain or tenderness \n2. No focal neurologic deficit\n3. Normal level of alertness\n4. No evidence of intoxication\n5. No clinically apparent, painful distracting injury\n\n## Canadian C-spine Rules (CCR)\n\nThe basic approach in the flowchart: \n\n1. Make sure that the patient meets the eligibility requirements as in the CCR study. \n2. Determine if there are high-risk findings. If so, go directly to imaging.\n3. If there are no high-risk findings, check to see if the patient qualifies as a low-risk candidate where you might be able to clinically clear the c-spine without imaging.\n4. If the patient is neither high or low risk, then the patient is moderate risk and requires imaging.\n\n![Canadian C-spine Rule flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/cspine-rules/image-2.png)\n\n## References\n\n- Stiell IG et al.
