There were 4 subgroups:\n\n- Group 1: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses present\n  - 10/12 (83%) had SBP &lt;80 mmHg\n- Group 2: Femoral and carotid pulses only\n  - 10/12 (83%) had SBP &lt;70 mmHg\n- Group 3: Carotid pulse only\n  - 0/4 (0%) had SBP >60 mmHg\n- Group 4: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses absent\n  - 2/3 (67%) had SBP &lt;60 mmHg\n\n**Conclusion:** ATLS guidelines for assessing SBP are inaccurate and generally overestimate the patient’s SBP. \n\n**Click [here](https://www.aliem.com/2013/is-atls-wrong-about-palpable-blood-pressure/) for full ALiEM blog post**\n\n## References\n\n- Poulton TJ.
