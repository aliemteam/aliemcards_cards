Also consider performing Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy to evaluate the patients airway and if needed as a primary airway technique. Finally consider NOT paralyzing these patients, and possibly using Ketamine as your induction agent\n- _Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy_: consider performing on all patients with voice change to look for largnyeal edema\n- **_Pearl:_** Be sure to prescribe patients Epi-pen if discharged home\n\n## Admission guidelines for angioedema\n\n([Ishoo et al., Head Neck Surg, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18374684))  \n\n- 93 episodes in 80 patients (1985-95) with no deaths \n- 9.7% cases required intubation/tracheostomy\n- _Causes:_ 39% from <span class=\"drug\">ACE-I</span>\n- _Disposition:_ 25% outpt, 23% floor, 53% ICU\n- ICU admissions correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, rash \n- Airway intervention correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, stridor\n\n**Proposed staging system:**\n\n- **Stage I:** Facial rash, facial edema, lip edema - outpatient\n- **Stage II**: Soft palate edema – outpatient or floor\n- **Stage III:** Lingual edema --> ICU (7% required airway intervention)\n- **Stage IV:** Laryngeal edema –> ICU (24% required airway intervention)\n\n## References\n\n- Ishoo E et al.
