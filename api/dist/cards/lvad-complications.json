Is there a hum?\n  - Yes - LVAD is working. \n  - No - LVAD is not working.\n- **B** attery: Make sure it is plugged in.\n- **C** ontroller: Check for alarms.\n- **D** riveline: Check device type and evidence of infection or damage\n- **E** chocardiogram\n\n### Step 3\n\n- Obtain VAD variables: Flow, Power, Speed, Pulsatility Index\n\n### Step 4\n\n- Obtain ECG\n- Obtain labs:\n  - CBC\n  - Electrolytes\n  - Coagulation studies\n  - LDH\n  - Type and screen given GI bleed risk\n  - ± Blood cultures if infection concern\n  - ± ABG\n\n## Echocardiogram Findings - Causes & Management\n\n### Big right ventricle, big left ventricle\n\n**Potential Causes**\n\n- Pump failure\n- Pump thrombosis\n- Valve disorders\n\n**Management**\n\n- <span class=\"drug\">Heparin</span>\n- <span class=\"drug\">Antiplatelet agents</span>\n- <span class=\"drug\">Thrombolytics</span>\n\n### Big right ventricle, small left ventricle\n\n**Potential Causes**\n\n- Right heart failure\n- ST-elevation MI\n- Pulmonary hypertension\n- Note: If LV to outflow cannula size ratio is 1:1, then high risk for suction event\n\n**Management**\n\n- IV fluids\n- ECG\n- Consider inotropes\n\n### Small right ventricle, small left ventricle\n\n**Potential Causes**\n\n- Hypovolemia\n- Sepsis\n- GI bleed\n\n**Management**\n\n- IV fluids\n- Consider blood transfusion\n- Antibiotics\n\n## LVAD Complications\n\n### Arrhythmia\n\n- Up to 50% experience sustained VT/VF in first 4 weeks after LVAD placement\n- Difficult to determine primary vs. secondary cause:\n  - Primary: Compromised myocardium + scar tissue\n  - Secondary: Electrolyte abnormalities, hypotension, suction events\n- Management depending on the cause:\n  - IV fluid challenge is reasonable\n  - Reduce pump speed\n  - Correct electrolytes\n  - Electrical or pharmacologic: amiodarone, cardioversion\n\n### Infection\n\n- Up to 42% experience sepsis within 1 year (REMATCH Study). Most infections are in first 3 months, and 9% are fungal.\n- Treat with broad spectrum antibiotics + antifungal\n\n### Thrombus (pump thrombus, PE, stroke/TIA)\n\n- High risk despite anticoagulation. \n- Pump thrombus suggested by warm device and increased power output. \n- Lab finding: Elevated LDH\n- Treat with Heparin, thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents\n\n### Bleeding\n\n- Patients may have an acquired Von Willebrand Disease coagulopathy.\n- If life-threatening, reverse anticoagulation and transfuse as needed.\n\n### Suction Event\n\n- An underfilled LV causing suction of myocardium into LVAD\n- Can be caused by right heart failure, hypovolemia, sepsis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias\n- Treat with IV fluids to increase LV filling.\n\n### RV Failure\n\n- Due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or previous RV failure\n- Treat with IV fluids and consider inotropes. \n- Start aspirin and heparin, if AMI.\n\n### Cannula Malposition\n\n- Consider in setting of new VT, suction event, chest compressions, or trauma\n- Requires surgical exploration\n\n### Device Malfunction, Pump Failure\n\n- Suggested if no hum and mean arterial pressure (MAP) &lt;40 mmHg.\n- Treat cardiogenic shock: IV fluids, vasopressors, ACLS protocols, consider heparin for thrombosis\n\n### Cardiac Arrest\n\n- Multiple potential causes including all those listed above.\n- Follow ACLS algorithms EXCEPT:\n  - Chest compressions are controversial as they could dislodge the device.\n  - Do NOT place defibrillation pads directly over device.\n  - Assign one person to assess device placement during and after code.\n\n## Altered LVAD Patient\n\n![Altered LVAD patient clinical pathway diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/lvad-complications/image-2.png)\n\n## References\n\n- Partyka C, Taylor B.
