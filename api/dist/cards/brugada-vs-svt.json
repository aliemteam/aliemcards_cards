Is there an ABSENCE of RS complex in all precordial leads (V1-V6?)\n2. Is the R to S interval >100 msec (2.5 boxes) in one precordial lead?\n3. Is there atrioventricular (AV) dissociation?\n4. Is there morphology criteria for VT?\n\n## 1. Is there an ABSENCE of RS complex in all precordial leads (V1-V6?)\n\n- **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 21%, Specificity 100%)\n- **NO:** Move to Question 2\n\n![Example of an RS complex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/brugada-vs-svt/image-1.png)\n\n## 2. Is the R to S interval > 100 msec (2.5 boxes) in one precordial lead?\n\n- **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 66%, Specificity 98%)\n- **NO:** Move to Question 3\n\n![Example of how to measure the R-S interval](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/brugada-vs-svt/image-2.png)\n\n## 3. Is there Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation?\n\n- **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 82%, Specificity 98%)\n- **NO: **Move to Question 4\n\n![Example of AV dissociation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/brugada-vs-svt/image-3.png)\n\n## 4. Is there morphology criteria for VT?\n\nDetermine if you have a LBBB morphology (dominant S wave in V1) or a RBBB morphology (dominant R wave in V1) then use the appropriate section below to help differentiate. Is there morphology criteria for VT?\n\n- **YES:** VT diagnosis (Sensitivity 98.7%, Specificity 96.5%)\n- **NO:** SVT with aberrance (Sensitivity 96.5%, Specificity 98.7%)\n\n![Examples of LBBB and RBBB morphologies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliemteam/aliemcards_cards/master/cards/brugada-vs-svt/image-4.png)\n\n## Dr. Stephen Smith's Expert Review\n\nValidations of the Brugada method have not had very good results.\n\nHere is a [paper by Isenhour et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10917326) that had, for Emergency Physician (EP) #1, a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI = 78% to 91%) and a specificity of 43% (95% CI = 25% to 59%), while EP #2 attained 79% (95% CI = 73% to 87%) and 70% (95% CI = 51% to 84%). \n\nVerekei has subsequently published 2 criteria which are much easier to apply and performed better than the Brugada criteria: \n\n1. [Heart Journal 2007](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/28/5/589/2887583/Application-of-a-new-algorithm-in-the-differential): Still a bit complex\n2. [Heart Rhythm 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180024): Uses aVR only\n\nI have a [post on differentiating VT and SVT with aberrancy using the Sasaki rule](http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2011/10/wide-complex-tachycardia-ventricular.html), which has not been validated either, but is even simpler than either Vereckei rule. I use it as a final step if I don’t have the diagnosis from 6 earlier steps. Of course, the diagnosis is not nearly as important as the management, which is easily accomplished by electrical cardioversion.\n\n## References\n\n- Brugada P et al.
