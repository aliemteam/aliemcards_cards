Use an overhand grasp on the probe to apply steady downward pressure.\n- Include views of the entire heart with all 4 chambers and surrounding pericardium\n- FAST is **POSITIVE** if free fluid is identified between the heart and pericardial sac. \n\n## Struggling with the Exam?\n\n### Can’t find the spleen or left kidney?\n\n- The left kidney is often located more superior and posterior compared to the right kidney. Try placing the probe more posterior towards the left flank.\n\n### Can’t find the bladder?\n\n- Make sure you’re as close to the symphysis pubis as possible (don’t be shy!), and aiming the transducer towards the patient’s feet. Visualization of the bladder is improved prior to emptying of the bladder. Try FAST prior to insertion of a foley catheter or prior to the patient emptying their bladder.\n\n### Rib shadows obstructing view in RUQ and LUQ views?\n\n- Try rotating the transducer obliquely parallel to the ribs in order to fit between an intercostal space. A phased array transducer’s smaller footprint can reduce or eliminate rib shadows.\n\n### Can’t see the entire heart on the subxiphoid view?\n\n- Try moving the probe more to the patient’s right to use the liver as an acoustic window. You can also try increasing the depth of the image.\n\n## Common Errors: Failure to…\n\n- Fan through entire depth and length of target organs\n- Perform serial FAST exams in patients who develop changes in their vitals or exam\n- Appreciate that the FAST exam is not sensitive for the detection of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage or for the identification of solid organ injury\n- Appreciate that the FAST exam is not sensitive for the detection of small amounts (&lt;400-500 cc) of intra-peritoneal fluid\n- Appreciate that intra-peritoneal blood will not appear anechoic in patients presenting with delayed trauma. Blood clots typically exhibit mixed echogenicity.\n- Appreciate that the FAST exam cannot reliably differentiate between ascites and blood in patients with a history of ascites.\n\n## References\n\n- Rozycki GS, Ballard RB, Feliciano DV, Schmidt JA, Pennington SD.
