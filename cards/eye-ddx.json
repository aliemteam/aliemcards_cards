The rule of 2s is easy to remember as it contains the number 2 in the context of eyes and proceeds from layer to layer of the eye in an anterior to posterior direction highlighting the 2 major associated diagnoses of that layer.  \r\n\r\nThere is significant overlap among conditions that cause a red, painful or red and painful eye. Here are additional cards that may help in your evaluation:\r\n\r\n- [Painful Eye](/cards/eye-painful)\r\n- [Red Eye](/cards/red-eye)\r\n\r\n## Anterior Eye – Utilize slit lamp exam\r\n![anterior eye picture - conjunctiva (conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage), cornea (corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer/infiltrate/keratitis, anterior chamber (cell/flare (uveitis, iritis), fluid (hyphema (blood), hypopyon (pus))), lens (cataract or swelling (as in hyperglycemia), dislocation)](https://aliemteam.github.io/aliemcards_cards/images/eye-ddx/image-1.png)\r\n\r\n## Posterior Eye – Use fundoscopy and ultrasound\r\n![posterior eye picture - vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage, posterior vitreous detachment), retina (retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion (central retinal artery or vein occlusion), optic nerve (optic neuritis (inflammation), temporal arteritis (ischemia)](https://aliemteam.github.io/aliemcards_cards/images/eye-ddx/image-2.png)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- Nawar, E.W., Niska, R.W., Xu, J.
