# Acute Chest Syndrome

## Background

* A leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in sickle cell patients
* Up to half of sickle cell patients will develop
* More common in HbSS but can occur in any phenotype
* Higher incidence in children but *more severe and worse outcomes in adults*
* Defined as combination of **fever and/or respiratory symptoms and a radiodensity on chest x-ray**

## Causes

* Children: most commonly associated with infection or reactive airway disease
  * Atypical bacteria or RSV
  * Inflammation results in pulmonary vaso-occlusion
* Adults- bone marrow/fat emboli
  * Vaso-occlusion in bone marrow leads to release of bone marrow/fat emboli into circulation
  * Mechanical obstruction occurs in small vessels of lungs

## Pathophysiology

  * **Intra-pulmonary vascular obstruction, as a result of infection or emboli, causes hypoxia, inflammation, and acidosis that further worsen vaso-occlusion**

## Management

* Supplemental oxygen and incentive spirometry
  * Consider NIPPV if unable to maintain oxygen saturation > 92% with NC or NRB
* IVF to avoid hypovolemia
  * D5 1/2 NS (resuscitate to euvolemia)
* Antibiotics
  * Third generation cephalosporin + macrolide
  * Fluoroquinolone
* Blood transfusion 
  * Exchange transfusion has potential advantage- higher volume of pRBC to lower Hgb S percentage.
  * Simple transfusion- should be used, regardless of severity, to achieve goal of Hgb > 10 g/dL if anemia present
* Pain control
  * Caution over-sedation that can worsen respiratory drive
* *Adjuncts*:
  * Bronchodilators can be considered for patients with reactive airway disease
  * Glucocorticoids shown to decrease hospital stay, but associated with re-admission

>*All patients with suspected ACS should receive VTE prophylaxis unless contraindicated*

## Bottom Line

* Acute Chest Syndrome occurs in both children and adults with any sickle cell disease phenotype

* Treatment focuses on minimizing vaso-occlusion in pulmonary vasculature: O2, IVF, abx, pRBC

* Although pulmonary infection is less common in adults, give antibiotics since cannot distinguish from embolic cause
