## Background [1, 2]

* A leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in sickle cell patients
* Up to half of sickle cell patients will develop
* More common in HbSS but can occur in any phenotype
* Higher incidence in children but more severe and worse outcomes in adults
* Definition: fever and/or respiratory symptoms + radiodensity on chest x-ray

## Causes

* Children: Most commonly associated with infection or reactive airway disease
  * Atypical bacteria or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
  * Inflammation results in pulmonary vaso-occlusion

* Adults: Bone marrow/fat emboli
  * Vaso-occlusion in bone marrow leads to release of bone marrow/fat emboli into circulation
  * Mechanical obstruction occurs in small vessels of lungs

## Pathophysiology

* Intra-pulmonary vascular obstruction, as a result of infection or emboli, causes hypoxia, inflammation, and acidosis that further worsen vaso-occlusion.

## Management [3-5]

* Supplemental oxygen and incentive spirometry

  * Consider noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation if unable to maintain oxygen saturation > 92% with nasal cannula or non rebreather mask.
* IV fluids to avoid hypovolemia

  * D5 1/2 NS (resuscitate to euvolemia)

* Antibiotics

  * Third generation cephalosporin + macrolide
  * Fluoroquinolone

* Blood transfusion 

  * Exchange transfusion has potential advantage- higher volume of packed Red Blood Cells to lower the Hgb S percentage.
  * Simple transfusion- should be used, regardless of severity, to achieve goal of Hgb > 10 g/dL if anemia present

* Pain control

  * Caution over-sedation that can worsen respiratory drive

* Adjuncts

  * Bronchodilators can be considered for patients with reactive airway disease.
  * Glucocorticoids shown to decrease hospital stay, but associated with re-admission

* Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

  * All patients with suspected Acute Chest Syndrome should receive prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism unless contraindicated.

## Bottom Line

* Acute Chest Syndrome occurs in both children and adults regardless of sickle cell disease phenotype.
* Treatment focuses on minimizing vaso-occlusion in pulmonary vasculature: Oxygen, IV fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusion
* Although pulmonary infection is less common in adults, cover with antibiotics since  cannot distinguish from embolic cause in initial phase.
