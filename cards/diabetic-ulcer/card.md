# Diabetic Leg Ulcer and Osteomyelitis

- Most common cause of nontraumatic amputations = diabetic foot problems

**Osteomyelitis:**

- Diagnostic gold standard for osteomyelitis = Bone biopsy and culture
- If inadequately treated, increases risk of amputation
- Starting pretest probability for osteomyelitis in DM patient with leg ulcer = 15%

## Physical Exam of DM leg ulcer

**Ulcer type:** Difficult to distinguish ulcer secondary to diabetic vs vascular insufficiency

**Classic ulcer location and appearance**:

- **Venous ulcer**: Above medial/lateral malleoli, irregular borders
- **Arterial ulcer**: Affects toes or shins, pale/punched out borders, painful
- **Diabetic ulcer**: Areas of increased pressure (plantar foot, shoe friction areas)

**Probe-to-Bone test:** Using a sterile, blunt, stainless steel probe, push against ulcerbase to see if can contact hard, gritty structure (bone)

**Measure ulcer area**: Multiply greatest width by greatest length of ulcer

**Wagner grading scale of ulcers**

- Grade 0 – No open lesions; may have evidence of healed lesions/deformitities
- Grade 1 – Superficial ulcer
- Grade 2 – Deeper ulcer to tendon, bone, or joint capsule
- Grade 3 – Deeper tissues involved, with abscess, osteomyelitis, or tendonitis 
- Grade 4 – Localized gangrene of toe or forefoot
- Grade 5 – Gangrene of foot (partial or total)

**Xray findings** = loss of trabecular pattern, periosteal reaction, frank bone destruction 

## Bottom Line

**Best positive predictors of osteomyelitis of diabetic leg ulcer are:** 

1. Probe-to-bone test
2. Ulcer area >2 cm2
3. ESR >70 mm/hr

**Best negative predictor is MRI foot**

- Sensitivity 90%
- Specificity 83%

| **Finding**                          | **(+) LR** | **(-) LR** |
| ------------------------------------ | :--------: | :--------: |
| Erythema, swelling, purulence        |     1.5    |    0.84    |
| Positive probe-to-bone test          |   **6.4**  |    0.39    |
| Ulcer area (LxW) >2 cm2              |   **7.2**  |    0.48    |
| Clinical gestalt+/- Wagner grade     |     5.5    |    0.54    |
| ESR >70 mm/h                         |   **11**   |    0.34    |
| Plain film evidence of osteomyelitis |     2.3    |    0.63    |
| MRI foot                             |     3.8    |  **0.14**  |

**Note:**

- Serum WBC and soft tissue swab culture = not diagnostic
- Soft tissue culture: Identified same pathogens as bone culture only 19-36% isolates. Not reliably predictive.
