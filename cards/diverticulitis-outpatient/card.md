# Diverticulitis Outpatient Treatment

The **classic teaching** for the treatment ofdiverticulitis has included:

- Hospital admission
- Bowel rest (NPO)
- IV fluids
- Broad spectrum IV antibiotics

Early literature suggests that there is a small sub-population who fare well with outpatient treatment. ([Friend et al., Ann Emerg Med, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21770056))

## Outpatient treatment

**BOTTOM LINE:** Uncomplicated diverticulitis might be treated as outpatient if:

- Can tolerate POs
- No significant comorbidities
- Able to obtain antibiotics
- Have adequate pain control
- Access to followup and social support 

[Mizuki study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼15801924):

- Prospective observational study of outpatient abx treatment for diverticulitis in Japan 
- _Diverticulitis diagnosis_: Based on exam, blood tests, and ultrasound (no CT) 
- _Inclusion criteria_: Age &lt; 80 years, diverticulitis
- _Exclusion criteria_: “Severe” diverticulitis on ultrasound, uncontrolled DM, heart failure, renal dz, end-stage cancer, antibiotics within past 24 hrs. 
- _Study group_: n=70 during 1997-2002 period
- _Method_: Day 4 and Day 7 followup
- _Result_: 68 of 70 (97%) were successfully treated as outpatient 

[Ridgway study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼19016815):

- Randomized controlled trial of IV vs PO antibiotics (cipro/metronidazole combo) fordiverticulitis in Ireland. All patients admitted to hospital.
- _Diverticulitis diagnosis_: Purely based on clinical exam (no imaging test).
- _Inclusion criteria_: Left iliac fossa pain and LLQ abdominal tenderness
- _Exclusion criteria:_ Generalized abdominal tenderness or evidence of perforation 
- _Study group_: n=79 (41 with PO abx, 38 with IV abx)
- _Result_: No difference in tenderness and days-to-resolution between groups. 

[Alonso study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼19906059):

- Cohort study with outpatient treatment using PO antibiotics (amox/clavulanic +metronidazole combo). All patients admitted to hospital.
- _Inclusion criteria_: Diverticulitis diagnosis by clinical exam, labs, and CT imaging 
- _Exclusion criteria_: Unable to tolerate POs, comorbidities (DM, renal insufficiency,heart failure, COPD, no family support)
- _Study group_: n=70
- _Methods_: Follow-up 4-7 days after initial ED visit.
- _Result_: 68 (97%) were successfully treated as outpatient. 2 (3%) failed outpatient tx because for increased abdominal pain (1) and vomiting (1). 

[Etzioni study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=￼￼19906059):

- Retrospective study of outpatient diverticulitis patients
- _Diverticulitis diagnosis:_ By clinical exam, labs, and CT
- _Inclusion criteria_: Outpatient diverticulitis patients
- _Exclusion criteria_: Prior dx of diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel dzStudy group: n=693 outpatient diverticulitis patients
- _Result_: 554 (94%) were successfully treated as outpatient.
- _Predictors of treatment failure_:
  - Female: OR = 3.08 [1.31-7.28]
  - Free fluid on CT: OR = 3.19 [1.45-7.05]
  - WBC, perforation, abscess, phlegmon were not predictive (OR crossed 1.0)

**Words of caution:** 

- This only provides guidelines, based on the limited evidence out there. 
- Still use your **common sense**. 
- Still consider admitting patients who are elderly (>80 years old) or have evidence of any perforation on CT. 
- If on the fence,admit the patient.
