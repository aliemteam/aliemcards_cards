# Chest Pain: Critical Elements of a Patient History

## Take Home Points

**Clinical factors that INCREASE likelihood of ACS/AMI:**

1. CP radiating bilaterally > right > left
2. Diaphoresis associated with CP
3. N/V associated with CP
4. Pain with exertion

**Clinical factors that DECREASE likelihood of ACS/AMI:**
Chest pain that is:

1. Pleuritic
2. Positional
3. Sharp, stabbing
4. Reproducible with palpation

## Severity of pain is not related to likelihood of AMI at presentation, or composite end points (death, revascularization, or AMI) at 30 days

[Edwards et al., 2011]((http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802776))

**Objective:** 

- Determine any correlation between severity of CP and the risk of AMI at presentation, or composite end points (death, revascularization, or acute myocardial infarction) at 30 days
- Severe CP was defined as 9–10 on a 10-point pain scale. 

**Results:** (n=3,306)

- Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 1–8 (82% of patients) = 3.0%
- Risk of AMI with Pain Score of 9–10 (18% of patients) = 3.9%
- Not statistically significant different

## Many “atypical” symptoms are more likely to render the diagnosis of ACS than traditional “typical” symptoms 

[Body et al., 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036454)

**Objective:** 

- Assess the value of individual symptoms for predicting a diagnosis of AMI or the occurrence of adverse events (death, AMI, revascularization via PCI or CABG) within 6 months

**Results:** (n=796)

- Strongest positive predictor of AMI: 
- Diaphoresis with CP
- Other positive predictors of AMI and adverse events
- Nausea and vomiting with CP
- CP with radiation to both shoulders > right shoulder > left shoulder
- Central chest pain
- Strongest negative predictor of AMI
- Pain located in the left anterior chest
- Other negative predictors of AMI and adverse events
- CP described as pain being the same as previous AMI
- Presence of CP at rest

## No characteristics of CP alone, or in combination, identify a group of patients that can be safely discharge home without further diagnostic testing

[Swap et al., 2006](%20http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16304077)

**Objective:** In a literature review (1970-2005), identify the elements of a CP history that might be most helpful to the clinician in identifying ACS.

**CP characteristics that INCREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**

| Characteristic                   | # of Patients  |  LR |
| -------------------------------- | -------------: | --: |
| Radiating to both shoulders/arms |            893 | 4.1 |
| Radiating to right shoulder      |            770 | 4.7 |
| Pain precipitated with exertion  |            893 | 2.4 |
| Pain associated with diaphoresis |          8,426 | 2.0 |

**CP characteristics that DECREASE likelihood of ACS/MI:**

|  Characteristic                | # of Patients   | LR  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------: | --: |
| Pain that is sharp/stabbing    |           1,088 | 0.3 |
| Pleuritic pain                 |           8,822 | 0.2 |
| Positional pain                |           8,330 | 0.3 |
| Pain reproducible by palpation |           8,822 | 0.3 |

**NOTE:** Beware the chest pain which radiates to the RIGHT shoulder (LR = 4.7).

## Clinical features have a limited role in triage decision-making for ACS/AMI

[Goodacre et al., 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11874776)

**Study Design:** Prospective, observation cohort study 

**Objective:** Assess the performance of clinical features used in the diagnosis of CP, specifically in patients who were clinically stable and had a non-diagnostic ECG.

**Results:** (n=893)

-  Predictive of ACS/AMI:
  - Exertional pain
  - Pain radiating to both arms > right arm
-  NOT predictive of ACS/AMI: 
  - Presence of chest wall tenderness
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Diaphoresis

## History alone can help, but can NOT rule out ACS/AMI! 

[Panju et al., 1998](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9786377)

**Objective:** To identify clinical features that would increase or decrease the probability of an AMI, presenting with acute CP through a literature review (1980-1991).

**Features that INCREASE the probability of an AMI**

|  Clinical Feature                          | LR  |
| ------------------------------------------ | --: |
| Chest pain that radiates to both arms      | 7.1 |
| Chest pain that radiates to right shoulder | 2.9 |

**Features that DECREASE the probability of an AMI**

|  Clinical Feature                    |  LR |
| ------------------------------------ | --: |
| Pleuritic chest pain                 | 0.2 |
| Chest pain that is sharp or stabbing | 0.3 |
| Positional chest pain                | 0.3 |
| Chest pain reproduced by palpation   | 0.3 |
