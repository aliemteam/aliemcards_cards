## Why are so many opioid conversion recommendations different?

Many opioid conversion tables exist to transition, or rotate, between existing chronic pain regimens. The data used in these tables are derived from both single-dose and chronic, steady-state opioid regimens that may not be applicable in the Emergency Department. The information below is taken when possible from published evidence using single dose or acute pain as encountered in the ED.

_\* Not half-life time_

## Not recommended for opioid-equivalent conversion in the acute setting

* <span class="drug">**Methadone**</span>: If opioid medications are necessary, short acting (**oxycodone**, **hydromorphone**) agents and frequent reassessment should be used. The patient may have tolerance to opioid agonists, but side effects will be additive.
* <span class="drug">**Buprenorphine**</span>: Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with tighter binding affinity than full agonists. If opioid medications are necessary, short acting agents and frequent reassessment should be used. Note that since buprenorphine has a tighter binding affinity, full agonists will have less effect.

## Pharmacology

All of these compounds bind the mu-opioid receptor (among others) which is responsible for both the analgesic effect as well as sedation and respiratory depression. The potency of each compound at the receptor describes some of the dosing differences. 

For example, <span class="drug">**fentanyl**</span> is 50-100 times more potent at the mu-opioid receptor than <span class="drug">**morphine**</span>. 

## Pharmacokinetics \[1-3]

### Absorption and distribution affect “apparent” potency

Both administration route and chemical characteristics like lipophilicity affect “apparent” potency. 

* <span class="drug">**Morphine**</span> administered IV will have a more rapid time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and higher serum concentration (Cmax) resulting in a quicker onset of action. The effect will be a more rapid onset of action and a higher “apparent” potency than the equivalent morphine oral dose. 
* <span class="drug">**Fentanyl**</span> is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood brain barrier quickly resulting in a very rapid onset of action when administered IV. This makes it appear more potent than an equivalent dose of morphine administered IV.

### Metabolism accounts for some clinical effect differences

Some opioids have active metabolites that are at least partly responsible for analgesia and thus toxicity. Differences in metabolism will alter their clinical effects. For example, cytochrome P450 2D6 is responsible for metabolism of <span class="drug">**codeine**</span>, <span class="drug">**hydrocodone**</span>, <span class="drug">**hydromorphone**</span>, and <span class="drug">**tramadol**</span> and is highly genetically variable.  

* Approximately 5-10% of patients are CYP2D6 poor-metabolizers, resulting in little metabolism of <span class="drug">**codeine**</span> into <span class="drug">**morphine**</span> and very little to no clinical effect. 
* Conversely, 1-5% of patients are CYP2D6 ultra-metabolizers, resulting in a significantly greater <span class="drug">**codeine**</span> metabolism into <span class="drug">**morphine**</span> and potential toxicity. 
* CYP2D6 is responsible for <span class="drug">**tramadol**</span> metabolism and a poor-metabolizer will have less analgesic effect due to lower concentrations of the active metabolite, but the risk of adverse effects such as seizures remains. An ultra-metabolizer will have higher concentrations of the more potent active metabolite, potentially resulting in toxicity.
