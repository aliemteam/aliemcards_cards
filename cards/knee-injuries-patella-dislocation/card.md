# Knee Injuries: Patella Dislocation

![Patella dislocation drawing](image-1.png)

## X-ray Views

- AP knee
- Lateral knee: Best to assess for displacement
- Patella view: Sunrise or Merchant view

## Acute Management

- Closed reduction
- Splint in above-knee plaster cast (from distal 2/3s of thigh to MTP foot joints), straight leg immobilizer, or hinged knee brace
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches

## Follow-up Timing

- Within 1-2 weeks
- Consider sooner follow-up to assess for associated osteochondral fractures and medial patellofemoral ligament injury, which may require operative repair.

## Notes

- Most managed non-operatively
- Complications: Recurrent dislocations
