# Benzodiazepine Metabolism by the Liver

## Take Home Points

- **ALL benzodiazepines are metabolized by the liver.** Some are just metabolized by different pathways that are less dependent on global liver function.
- **The ‘LOT’ drugs are those metabolized mostly by conjugation.**

  - L – <span class="drug">Lorazepam</span>
  - O – <span class="drug">Oxazepam</span>
  - T – <span class="drug">Temazepam</span>

- The ‘LOT’ drugs do not have active metabolites after hepatic conjugation, and therefore have minimally affected half-lives in patients with liver disease. 

## Non-LOT Benzodiazepine Medications
These benzodiazepines may have prolonged effects in patients with market liver disease.
- Primarily metabolized via hepatic CYP-mediated oxidation. 
- Examples: Drugs with active metabolites include - 
  - <span class="drug">Diazepam</span>
  - <span class="drug">Clonazepam</span>
  - <span class="drug">Midazolam</span>

Some practitioners like to take advantage of the longer duration of action and active metabolites.
