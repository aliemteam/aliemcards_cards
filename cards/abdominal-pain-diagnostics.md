# Abdominal Pain - Diagnostic Studies

## Imaging

**Plain abdominal radiography**

When compared to unenhanced helical CT, 3-view xrays demonstrated:

- Sensitivity = 30%, Specificity = 88%, Accuracy = 56%
- Negative predictive value = 51%
- **Pearl:** A 3-way acute abdominal series is too insensitive to rule-out any major acute causes of abdominal pain with confidence. No need to order routinely. If you are worried about a perforated viscus, order an upright chest x-ray instead -- more accurate and less radiation. 

Obtain plain film if suspicious for:

- Pneumoperitoneum (although upright CXR is better)
- Small bowel obstruction (where CT not readily available) 
- Localization of foreign body ingestion or catheter

**Abdominal/Pelvis CT**

- Median radiation dose = 15-31 mSv (CXR has 0.1 mSv dose.)
- Oral contrast likely does NOT provide more information in acute abdominal pain. Known 241-minute delay.

**Ultrasound**

- Increasing use of bedside U/S for point of care testing in EDs.
- _Advantage_: can be used for unstable patients, no radiation exposure 

## Lactate

Lactate is useful adjunct to risk stratify for mortality ([Shapiro et al. (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15855951))

| Lactate | Level (mmol/L) | 28-day in-hospital mortality | Early death (≤ 3d) |
| ------- | -------------: | ---------------------------: | -----------------: |
| Low     |        &lt;2.5 |                         4.9% |               1.5% |
| Medium  |       2.5-3.99 |                         9.0% |               4.5% |
| High    |             ≥4 |                        28.4% |              22.4% |

## Diseases

**Appendicitis**: CT is first-line, unless pediatric or pregnant patient. Then U/S is first line. MRI is an alternative to avoid CT radiation risk.

**Cholecystitis**: Normal LFTs do NOT rule it out. LFT's helpful as adjunct to determine likelihood for common bile duct stone.

**Diverticular disease**: Prevalence &lt;5% (age&lt;40 yrs), 30% (age 41-60 yrs), 65% (age 61-85 yrs)

**Ectopic pregnancy**: Discriminatory zone for gestational sac is B-HCG ≥6,500 (transabdominal U/S) or B-HCG ≥1,500 (transvaginal U/S).

**Mesenteric ischemia** of concern because of subtleties in presentation.

- **Multidetector CT angiography with reformats**: sens 96%, spec 94%
- **MR angiography**: Sensitivity 85-90% (SMA), 75-90% (celiac artery), 25% (IMA) 

**Nephrolithiasis**:

- **Microscopic hematuria:** sens 89%, spec 29%

**Pancreatitis**: Lipase (sens 90%, spec 93%) is better than amylase (sens 79%, spec 93%). Unlike level of elevated enzymes, CT correlates with severity.

**UTI**: Urine dipstick alone is adequately predictive, except for children, elderly, suspected urosepsis.

- **Nitrites:** Odds Ratio (OR) = 6.36
- **Leukocyte esterase:** OR = 4.52 
- **Blood:** OR = 2.23

**LUQ Pain:** Limited use for labs/imaging, unless elderly, immunosuppressed, or trauma patient
