# Background

The rule of 2s, as illustrated below, is a simple method with an anatomical approach to the major ocular diagnoses and is meant to provide a general framework to guide the physical exam and include or eliminate certain conditions. The rule of 2s is easy to remember as it contains the number 2 in the context of eyes and proceeds from layer to layer of the eye in an anterior to posterior direction highlighting the 2 major associated diagnoses of that layer.  

There is significant overlap among conditions that cause a red, painful or red and painful eye. Here are additional cards that may help in your evaluation:

- [Painful Eye](/cards/eye-painful)
- [Red Eye](/cards/red-eye)

## Anterior Eye – Utilize slit lamp exam
![anterior eye picture - conjunctiva (conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage), cornea (corneal abrasion, corneal ulcer/infiltrate/keratitis, anterior chamber (cell/flare (uveitis, iritis), fluid (hyphema (blood), hypopyon (pus))), lens (cataract or swelling (as in hyperglycemia), dislocation)](image-1.png)

## Posterior Eye – Use fundoscopy and ultrasound
![posterior eye picture - vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage, posterior vitreous detachment), retina (retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion (central retinal artery or vein occlusion), optic nerve (optic neuritis (inflammation), temporal arteritis (ischemia)](image-2.png)
