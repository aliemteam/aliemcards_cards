# Scaphoid Fracture - Adult

- **Most common** carpal fracture (70%), followed by triquetral and trapezium
- **Initial x-ray** (full scaphoid series): **Specificity is 100%** but **Sensitivity is 80%**
- **Pre-test probability** of scaphoid fracture in patient with scaphoid wrist pain and non-diagnostic x-rays is about 25% (17-38% across 4 studies in this meta-analysis)

- **_Clamp sign:_** Ask the patient “Exactly where does it hurt?” The patient will form a clamp with opposite thumb and index finger on both sides of the thumb
- **_Pain with resisted supination:_** Hold the hand of the injured extremity with the patient’s forearm in neutral position. Patient attempts to supination, resulting in pain when the examiner resists.

| **Imaging**                          | **Positive LR** [95% CI] | **Negative LR** [95% CI] |

**NOTE:** There is limited usefulness for LR’s with wide CIs.

## Management Plan Based on XRay Findings

- Displaced (>1 mm) or proximal pole frature: Orthopedic/Hand consult in ED
- Non- or minimally displaced fracture: Splint and Ortho/Hand clinic follow up in 5-7 days
- Suspected fracture but non-diagnostics xrays: 
  - Thumb spica splint
  - Follow up with primary care physician or Ortho/Hand clinic for repeat exam and potentially repeat x-rays within 10-14 days

## Pearls

- The clinical exam has **high sensitivity** but **low specificity**
- MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality, but cost-benefit must be balanced with patient’s economic loss from being splinted or a missed fracture.
- Avascular necrosis and nonunion can occur leading to carpal instability and osteoarthritis
  - Those at greatest risk: Displaced or initially missed scaphoid fractures
