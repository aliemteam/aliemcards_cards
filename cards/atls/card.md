# ATLS: Palpable pulses are inaccurate

**Take Home Points**

In Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), we learned that a carotid, femoral, and radial pulse correlates to a certain systolic blood pressure (SBP) in hypotensive trauma patients.  Specifically ATLS stated:

-  Carotid pulse only = SBP 60–70 mmHg
-  Carotid & Femoral pulse only = SBP 70–80 mmHg
-  Radial pulse present = SBP >80 mmHg

There were two studies \[[Poulton, 1988](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405); [Deakin, 2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771)] that evaluated this paradigm.  Although very small studies, they were done by two different authors, using different methods (BP cuff vs arterial line).  Both came to the same conclusion: 

- **ATLS overestimates SBP based on palpation of radial, femoral, & carotid pulses.** 

Another way to state this is, if using ATLS guidelines to guestimate BP, we are grossly underestimating the degree of hypovolemia our patients have.

## Poulton, 1988

"ATLS Paradigm Fails" \[[Poulton, 1988](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3337405)] 

 **What they did:** Manually measured SBP with sphygmomanometer in 20 hypovolemic trauma patients and compared with ATLS

- 5/20 (25%) pts were correctly predicted by ATLS guidelines
- 10/20 (50%) pts had false overestimation of BP by ATLS guidelines
- False overestimation of BP was greatest in pts with lowest BPs
- Mean difference of actual and estimated BP using ATLS was 34 mmHg

**Conclusion:**  Radial pulses are often present in severely hypotensive hypovolemic patients, meaning the ATLS paradigm is invalid.

## Deakin, 2000

"Accuracy of ATLS guidelines for predicting SBP" \[[Deakin, 2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10987771)] 

**What they did:** Measured SBP with arterial line in 20 patient with hypovolemic shock and compared to pulses palpated by an observer blinded to BP readings.

**What they found:** The disappearance of pulse always occurred in the following order radial > femoral > carotid pulse. There were 4 subgroups:

- Group 1: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses present
  - 10/12 (83%) had SBP &lt;80 mmHg
- Group 2: Femoral and carotid pulses only
  - 10/12 (83%) had SBP &lt;70 mmHg
- Group 3: Carotid pulse only
  - 0/4 (0%) had SBP >60 mmHg
- Group 4: Radial, femoral, and carotid pulses absent
  - 2/3 (67%) had SBP &lt;60 mmHg

**Conclusion:** ATLS guidelines for assessing SBP are inaccurate and generally overestimate the patient’s SBP.
