# Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

**Definition:** Physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse; occurs among heterosexual and same-sex couples

**Epidemiology:** Lifetime estimates for IPV in women= 22-39%

**Sequelae:** Untreated IPV results in many physical and psychological morbidities. 

**Pearl:** Physicians should screen, document,intervene, and provide resources.

## Screening

- U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: Level B recommendation for screening women of child-bearing age
  - High certainty that the net benefit is moderate. 
  - Costs and potential harms of screening appear to be outweighed by potential for early intervention with screening.
- Interview patient alone. Frame: “_Because violence is so common, we’re routinely asking our patients about their safety in their relationships_.”
- Increase suspicion of abuse when overly protective partner, history inconsistent with injury, vague complaints, or pregnancy.
