# Ectopic Pregnancy: Making the Diagnosis

[JAMA Rational Clinical Examination Series](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23613077)

Systematic review based on 14 studies (n=12,101) with a summary prevalence of ectopic pregnancy of 15% (95% CI, 10-22%) in women presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. 

## Background

- Leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester of pregnancy
- Incidence as high as 2.6%
- **Heterotopic pregnancy**: Incidence = 0.3-0.8% (1-3% if assisted reproduction)
- \#1 cause of 1<sup>st</sup> trimesterpregnancy-related death
- 8-31% initially diagnosed as “pregnancy of unknown location” (PUL), despite beta-hCG and ultrasonography
- More than half of patients with ectopic pregnancy will have ZERO risk factors

**Discriminatory zone:** Serum beta-HCG level cutoff above which intrauterine pregnancy is likely visible on ultrasound.

- Variable definition of cutoff with range of 1,500-3,000 mIU/mL
- No single serum beta-hCG value is predictive of an ectopic pregnancy
- If beta-HCG &ge;3,000 mIU/mL and an “empty uterus” on ultrasound, suggestive of ectopic pregnancy

## Diagnostic Tools to Risk Stratify

| **Finding**                  |  **Sensitivity** |  **Specificity** |     **(+) LR**    |      **(-) LR**      |
| ---------------------------- | :--------------: | :--------------: | :---------------: | :------------------: |
| **PHYSICAL EXAM**            |                  |                  |                   |                      |
| • Cervical motion tenderness | 0.45 (0.33-0.57) | 0.91 (0.80-0.96) |  **4.9** (1.7-14) |   0.62 (0.47-0.83)   |
| • Peritoneal findings        |     0.23-0.27    |     0.94-0.95    |    **4.2-4.5**    |       0.78-0.81      |
| • Adnexal mass               | 0.09 (0.02-0.27) | 0.96 (0.92-0.98) | **2.4** (1.6-3.7) |    0.94 (0.87-1.0)   |
| • Adnexal tenderness         | 0.61 (0.52-0.69) |  0.65 (0.42-0.83 |   1.9 (1.0-3.5)   |   0.57 (0.48-0.67)   |
| **IMAGING**                  |                  |                  |                   |                      |
| • Transvaginal ultrasound    | 0.88 (0.52-0.98) |  0.99 (0.96-1.0) | **111** (12-1028) | **0.12** (0.03-0.55) |

**Ultrasound:**

- Findings of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) such as gestational sac or fetal pole ruled out ectopic pregnancy, except in rare cases of heterotropic prengnacy.
- Bedside ultrasound is the single most useful diagnostic test (positive LR = 111). 

**Beta hCG:**

- The "discriminatory zone" continues to be debated - no consensus on the number
- A one-time hCG level does not rule out ectopic pregnancy

**CONCLUSIONS: **

1. **Transvaginal ultrasound** is the single-best test to assess for ectopic pregnancy.
2. Patient symptoms have limited risk-stratification value.
3. Most predictive exam findings for ectopic pregnancy: 

- Cervical motion tenderness (positive LR = 4.9)
- Peritoneal findings (positive LR = 4.2-4.5)
- Adnexal mass (positive LR = 2.4)
