Corticosteroids are a group of hormones that can be classified by 2 primary mechanisms of action at distinct receptors \[1].

1. **Mineralocorticoid activity** results in sodium retention in the renal distal tubule as well as potassium excretion. This results in increased overall sodium balance and increased extracellular fluid volume. Additionally this effect is responsible for increased reactivity to vasoactive compounds and subsequent increases in blood pressure.
2. **Glucocorticoid activity** results in gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and hyperglycemia. The glucocorticoid potency of a steroid is directly proportional to its anti-inflammatory potency. Anti-inflammatory effects from corticosteroids are related to reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels as well as reductions in circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils.

## Clinical Implications \[1-7]

* The anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids stems from the regulation of gene expression and subsequent changes in protein production. Because of this delayed clinical effect, for most indications intravenous (IV) and oral administration have a similar onset of action and efficacy.
* For most asthma and COPD exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, the equivalent of <span class="drug">prednisone</span> 40-60 mg is recommended. If administered IV, the equivalent dose of <span class="drug">methylprednisolone</span> is 40 mg. 
* <span class="drug">Dexamethasone</span> has a significantly longer half-life than other commonly used systemic corticosteroids. A single or 2-day course of dexamethasone may be appropriate for asthma exacerbations when adherence to a 5-day regimen of prednisone is a concern.
