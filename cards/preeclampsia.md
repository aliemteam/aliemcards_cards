# Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is on a spectrum of pregnancy related illness which includes eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets - debate exists about if this is a separate entity altogether). Without intervention, it can lead to seizures (eclampsia) and carries a high mortality for mom and baby. 

A pregnancy-related condition occurring anytime after 20 weeks pregnancy and up to 6 weeks postpartum, it is diagnosed by elevated blood pressure and and least one associated finding.

## Criteria

- Pregnancy, 20 weeks gestation up to 6 weeks post partum, 
- **AND** Hypertension >140/90 x 2 (at least 4 hours apart) or >160/110 x 2 (minutes apart) in a woman who was previously normotensive
- **AND** any one of the following
  - Proteinuria, defined as urine dipstick >1+ or >0.3 g in a 24-hour period
  - Platelets <100k/mcL
  - Serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL
  - Liver transaminases at least 2 times normal
  - Severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, not explained by another diagnosis
  - Pulmonary edema
  - Visual symptoms (e.g. blurred vision, flashing lights or sparks, scotoma)
  - Cerebral symptoms (e.g. severe persistent headache not responding to usual doses of analgesics)

## Treatment

- Delivering placenta resolves symptoms in 48 hours in most cases (except postpartum cases)
- <span class="drug">Magnesium Sulfate</span> IV for seizure prevention:
  - Loading dose: 4-6 g loading dose
  - Followed by continuous infusion: 1-2 g/hour for at least 24 hours
- BP management until systolic < 150 and diastolic < 100
  - <span class="drug">Labetalol</span> 20 mg IV every 10 min (max 80mg per dose) for a total of 300mg.
  - <span class="drug">Hydralazine</span> 5 mg IV, repeat in 20 min until goal achieved, max 30mg. 
  - <span class="drug">Nicardipine</span> infusion 3-9 mg hour
  - <span class="drug">Nitroglycerin</span> IV if pulmonary edema
- Corticosteroids if < 34 weeks gestation and delivery anticipated in next 48 hours.
  - <span class="drug">Betamethasone</span>: Two doses of 12 mg given intramuscularly 24 hours apart **OR**
  - <span class="drug">Dexamethasone</span> (sodium phosphate): Four doses of 6 mg given intramuscularly 12 hours apart. A non-sulfite containing preparation should be used as the sulfite preservative commonly used in dexamethasone preparations may be directly neurotoxic in newborns.

## Symptoms

- Severe headache
- Visual changes
- Upper abdominal pain
- Nausea or vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Altered mental status

## Risk Factors

- A past history of pre-eclampsia confers a 7-fold risk
- First-time pregnancy
- Twin pregnancies
- Family history in first-degree relative
- Advanced maternal age (> 40 years)
- Pre-gestational diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension
- Antiphospholipid antibody
- Obesity (BMI>25) (14)
- Chronic kidney disease

## Complications

Women with preeclampsia have increased risk of:

- Congestive heart failure
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Intracranial hemorrhage 
- Liver failure or rupture
- Placental abruption
- Pulmonary edema
- Renal failure
- Seizure
- Stroke
- Death
  - Worldwide 10-15% of maternal death from obstetric cause is due to preeclampsia/eclampsia [2]
  - In the U.S., it is one of 4 causes of obstetric deaths (hemorrhage, cardiovascular conditions, thromboembolism). 1 death / 100,000 births.  [12]
  - Fatality is 6.4 deaths/10,000 [13]

When does it happen and how often?

- After 20 weeks gestation and as late as 6 weeks post partum [1]
- 3-4% of all pregnancies in the U.S. and 4-5% worldwide [3]
- Almost 2 times higher prevalence in first pregnancy [3]
- Consider molar pregnancy if they are less than 20 weeks with criteria [11]
