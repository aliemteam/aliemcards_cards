# Pediatric Fever Without a Source: 3 months to 3 years

- Fever that should prompt workup in this age group: T &ge;39.0&deg;C / 102.2&deg;F
- Fever still defined as T &ge; 38&deg;C / 100.4&deg;F
- Named viral infections DO count as a source, such as: HSV gingivostomatitis, Coxsackie hand-foot-mouth, RSV bronchiolitis (although UTI may present concurrently with RSV)
- Unnamed, nonspecific viral infections MAY be considered a source for vaccinated, well-appearing child (especially with sick contacts)

## Background

Serious bacterial infection (SBI) includes:

- **Occult bacteremia**: Most commonly Strep pneumoniae
- **Meningitis**: &lt;0.03% risk in post-PCV7 vaccination era. Clinical exam is helpful.
- **UTI**: 60-65% of febrile UTI patients have pyelonephritis
- **Pneumonia**: Most common pathogens are viruses in post-PCV7 era
- Also: Gastroenteritis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, soft tissue infection

## Workup Guidelines (if nontoxic appearing)

### Girls

| Age                 | Diagnostic Testing                |
| :-----------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| ≤ 24 months         | Urinalysis, urine culture         |
| > 24 months         | No urine studies                  |

### Boys

| Age            | Circumcised                             | Uncircumcised                           |

| &le; 6 months  | _Consider_ urinalysis and urine culture | Urinalysis, urine culture               |
| 6-12 months    | No urine studies                        | _Consider_ urinalysis and urine culture |

### Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Diagnosis

Any of the following findings on UA:

- Positive LE
- Positive nitrites
- ≥10 WBC/hpf

### Additional Workup Beyond Urine Studies Based on Number of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCV)
