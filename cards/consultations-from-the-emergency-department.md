# Consultations from the Emergency Department

The referral-consultation process is of utmost importance in the emergency department (ED). Here are three easy, evidence-based mnemonics to hep you navigate these situations: 5Cs, PIQUED, and CONSULT (1-3)

## 5Cs model (1, 4, 5):

## PIQUED (2):

## CONSULT (3):

![CONSULT Model](/media/CONSULT-Model-Table.png "CONSULT")


These models are similar in content but have important differences.
 - 5C model has the largest evidence basis behind improving quality of consultation requests and communication. Most studies involve medical students.
- PIQUED was derived using residents from various specialties. Includes educational modifications and debriefing to allow learning from each interaction.
- CONSULT is the newest model. Also studied with residents and found to be beneficial after just one hour educational session.
