Look for signs of ectopic pregnancy\n\n**Transducer:** High-frequency endocavitary transducer\n\n**Windows:** Transvaginal view using cervix as window\n\n## 1. Coronal / transverse view\n\n**Directional indicator:** Pointed to patient’s right side\n\n![Appropriate transducer orientation for the coronal transvaginal exam](https://aliemteam.github.io/aliemcards_cards/images/first-trimester-transvaginal-ultrasound/image-1.png)\n\nFigure 1: Appropriate transducer orientation for the coronal transvaginal exam\n\n![Ectopic pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound, coronal view.

Shown is a **yolk sac within an extra-uterine gestational sac** (black arrow) adjacent to an empty **endometrium (e)**, outside of the **uterus**.\n\n## 2.  Sagittal / longitudinal view\n\n**Directional indicator**: Pointed to anterior of patient (towards the ceiling)\n\n![Appropriate transducer orientation for the sagittal transvaginal exam](https://aliemteam.github.io/aliemcards_cards/images/first-trimester-transvaginal-ultrasound/image-3.png)\n\nFigure 3: Appropriate transducer orientation for the sagittal transvaginal exam\n\n![Intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound, sagittal view. Shown is a gestational sac containing a yolk sac and within the endometrium](https://aliemteam.github.io/aliemcards_cards/images/first-trimester-transvaginal-ultrasound/image-4.png)\n\nFigure 4: Intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound, sagittal view. Shown is a **gestational sac** containing a **yolk sac** and within the **endometrium.**\n\nBoth of these windows include a complete sweep through the uterus in each direction looking for a gestational sac and yolk sac or fetal pole within the endometrium.\n\n## Interpretation and Tips\n\nAn IUP for point-of-care purposes is defined as a **yolk sac or fetal pole within a gestational sac within the endometrium**. This indirectly excludes an ectopic pregnancy in an appropriate clinical setting.\n\nConsider measuring the distance between the gestational sac and the edge of uterus. If this endomyometrial mantle thickness is &lt;8 mm, then consider the possibility of an interstitial ectopic pregnancy.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy will occasionally be seen as an extrauterine mass. However, free fluid in a pregnant patient without an IUP should also be considered an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.\n\n## Pitfalls\n\n**Inserting the transducer too deeply.** \n\n- The transducer should be inserted to the cervix, using it as a window. If you continue to push once at the cervix, the transducer will frequently slide into the posterior fornix and only bowel/rectum will be seen.\n\n**Scanning with a full bladder.** \n\n- While the transabdominal approach is enhanced by a full bladder, the patient should empty their bladder prior to transvaginal scanning to improve visualization.\n\n**Calling a gestational sac an IUP.** \n\n- At least a yolk sac is needed. A pseudogestational sac with an ectopic pregnancy is possible.\n\n**Relying on the quantitative beta-HCG and “discriminatory zone” for decision-making.** \n\n- Over 40% of ectopic pregnancies will have beta-HCG levels below the discriminatory zone.\n\n**Considering an “inconclusive scan” negative for ectopic**. \n\n- Ectopic pregnancies are almost always ruled-out by finding an IUP. Absence of an extrauterine mass does not exclude ectopic pregnancy.\n\n**Failure to recognize specific high-risk populations.** \n\n- Patients undergoing assisted reproductive therapy have a much higher (1-3%) incidence of heterotopic pregnancy. Identification of an IUP does not exclude a co-existing ectopic in this group.\n\n## References\n\n- Wang R, Reynolds TA, West HH, et al.
