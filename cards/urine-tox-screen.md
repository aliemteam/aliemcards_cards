**Pearl**:  MDMA (Ecstacy) may not be positive on amphetamine drug screen, unless specifically screen for MDMA.Â 

## Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines are popular. In the U.S., **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam**, and **diazepam** are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the outpatient setting.

Important points on benzodiazepine urine toxicology test:

1. Most benzodiazepines screens look for **oxazepam**, because **diazepam** and **chlordiazepoxide** both are metabolized to **oxazepam**.
2. The test does not specifically look for **alprazolam**, **clonazepam**, **lorazepam** (or many others). Therefore, a negative result does not necessarily rule out use of these agents.
3. Benzodiazepines vary in reactivity and potency and can trigger a positive result due to cross-reactivity.

### Bottom Line

A negative result doesn't rule out benzodiazepine ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **oxazepam**, **diazepam**, or **chlordiazepoxide** is present.

## Opioid vs Opiate

These two terms are often used interchangeably and really shouldn't be.

- **Opioid:** Broad category name which encompasses opiates, semi-synthetic, and synthetic agents
- **Opiate:** Refers to only naturally occurring opioids

| Opiates  | Semi-Synthetic | Synthetic |
| -------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Opium    | Heroin         | Fentanyl  |
| Morphine | Hydrocodone    | Methadone |
| Codeine  | Hydromorphone  | Tramadol  |
|          | Oxycodone      |           |
|          | Oxymorphone    |           |
|          | Buprenorphine  |           |

- **Oxycodone**, a semi-synthetic, is similar to **morphine**.
- **Methadone**, a synthetic, has a completely unrelated structure.

**LEARNING POINTS**

1. Notice the name of the urine drug screen next time you order one. It is opiates (not opioids).
2. The test was designed to look for heroin (technically a semi-synthetic) via its metabolite, **6-monacetyl morphine**. It also picks up **morphine** and **codeine**.
3. The test does not specifically look for **oxycodone**, **hydromorphone**, **hydrocodone**, etc. They can trigger a positive result due to their structural similarities, but not in every case. Therefore, a negative result doesn't rule out use of these common drugs of abuse.
4. Synthetics will never cross-react with the opiate urine drug screen. They are too structurally dissimilar. That's why there is a separate test for methadone.

### Bottom Line

A negative result doesn't rule out opioid ingestion, and a positive result only guarantees that **heroin, morphine, or codeine** is present.
