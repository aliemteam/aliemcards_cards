# Mnemonics: Predictors of a Difficult Airway

## Difficult bag mask ventilation (MOANS)

| Criteria                        | Finding                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M**ask seal                   | Bushy beards, crusted blood on the face, or disruption of lower facial continuity   |
| **O**besity, **O**bstruction    | Obesity, pregnancy, angioedema, Ludwigâ€™s angina, upper airway abscess, epiglottitis |
| **A**ge                         | Age >55 years                                                                       |
| **N**o teeth                    | Consider leaving dentures in for edentulous patients                                |
| **S**leep apnea, **S**tiff lung | COPD, asthma, ARDS                                                                  |

## Difficult laryngoscopy and intubation (LEMON)

| Criteria                     | Finding                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L**ook externally          | Use clinical gestalt, evidence of lower facialdisruption, bleeding, small mouth, agitated patient                                                                   |
| **E**valuate                 | Use the 3-3-2 rule: Mouth opening (3 fingers), mandibular space of chin to hyoid (3 fingers), glottic space of hyoid to thyroid notch (2 fingers)                   |
| **M**allampati score         | In order of increasing difficulty (Class I-IV)                                                                                                                      |
| **O**besity, **O**bstruction | Obesity = poor glottic views. Note the 4 cardinal signs of upper airway obstruction: Stridor, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing secretions, sensation of dyspnea |
| **N**eck immobility          | Consider using video laryngoscopy (e.g. trauma, arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis)                                                                                  |

## Difficult extraglottic device (RODS)

| Finding | 
\|---\|
\| **R**estricted mouth opening          |
\| **O**bstruction                       |
\| **D**isrupted or **D**istorted airway |
\| **S**tiff lung, cervical **S**pine    |

## Difficult cricothyrotomy (SHORT)

| Finding |
\| --- \| 
\| **S**urgery or other airway obstruction        |
\| **H**ematoma (includes infection & abscess)    |
\| **O**besity                                    |
\| **R**adiation distortion (and other deformity) |
\| **T**umor                                      |
