# Benzodiazepine and Barbiturate Comparison

## Clinical Implications [2,10]
* All benzodiazepines and barbiturates are metabolized by the liver.
  * Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, midazolam, phenobarbital from the list above all undergo phase I metabolism (CYP450 system) and will have prolonged half-lives, and durations of effect with hepatic dysfunction. 
  * Lorazepam is primarily metabolized via phase II metabolic pathways (glucuronidation) and will have less change in effect from hepatic disease.

* Benzodiazepines exert their primary action in the central nervous system and drug permeability across the blood brain barrier is enhanced by the lipophilicity of the molecule. A more lipophilic benzodiazepine will have a quicker onset of action once in systemic circulation. 
  * Diazepam has the fastest onset when administered IV directly into systemic circulation. Lorazepam has a slightly slower onset, and midazolam slower yet when administered IV.

* Lipophilicity also affects the rate of absorption via other routes of administration. A more lipophilic benzodiazepine is more slowly absorbed following intramuscular administration affecting the onset of action.
  * Midazolam has the fastest onset when administered IM, lorazepam is slower, and diazepam is unreliably absorbed following IM administration.

* Finally, lipophilicity also affects the duration of action. A more lipophilic compound quickly permeates the blood brain barrier resulting in rapid onset, it then quickly diffuses out of the CNS and into lipid tissue.
  * Diazepam has a short duration of action with a single dose despite its long T1/2. 
  * With repeated dosing the concentration will accumulate saturating the lipid tissue, and protein binding, and the duration of effect will lengthen to approach the T1/2.
