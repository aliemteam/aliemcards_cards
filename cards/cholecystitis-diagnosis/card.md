# Cholecystitis - Diagnostic tests

**JAMA Clinical Rational Examination Series:**
Meta-analysis of 17 studies which evaluated role of history, physical, and lab tests in working up cholecystitis

## History and Physical Exam

| **Finding**          | **(+) LR** | **(-) LR** |
| -------------------- | ---------: | ---------: |
| Anorexia             |    1.1-1.7 |    0.5-0.9 |
| Emesis               |    1.1-2.1 |    0.3-0.9 |
| Fever (&gt;35C)      |    1.0-2.3 |    0.8-1.0 |
| Guarding             |    1.1-2.8 |    0.5-1.0 |
| Murphy sign          |    0.8-8.6 |    0.2-1.0 |
| Nausea               |    1.0-1.2 |    0.6-1.0 |
| Rebound              |    0.6-1.7 |    0.8-1.4 |
| Rectal tenderness    |    0.5-2.3 |    1.0-1.3 |
| Rigidity             |    0.3-0.7 |    1.0-1.2 |
| RUQ mass             |    0.5-1.2 |    0.9-1.1 |
| RUQ pain             |    0.9-2.5 |    0.3-1.6 |
| RUQ tenderness       |    1.0-2.5 |    0.2-1.1 |

## Laboratory tests

| **Finding**                                   | **(+) LR** | **(-) LR** |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------: | ---------: |
| Alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt;120 U/L         |    0.4-1.6 |    0.6-2.0 |
| ALT &gt;40 U/L or AST &gt;48 U/L              |    0.5-2.0 |    0.8-1.4 |
| Total bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL                   |    0.7-2.3 |    0.7-1.2 |
| All 3 elevated: Total bili, AST, AP           |    1.0-2.8 |    0.8-0.9 |
| Any 1 elevated: Total bili, AST, AP           |    1.0-1.5 |    0.6-0.9 |
| WBC &gt;10K                                   |    1.2-1.9 |    0.5-1.8 |
| WBC &gt;10K and fever (&gt;35&deg;C)          |    0.9-2.8 |    0.8-1.0 |
| WBC &le;10K and no fever (&le;35&deg;C)       |    0.4-0.7 |    1.4-1.8 |

Use the Fagan nomogram

**Note:**

- All likelihood ratios (LR) cross or almost cross 1.0.
- This is no history, physical exam, or lab test that would comfortably allow you to rule- out or rule-in cholecystitis.
- Murphy’s sign is perhaps the most useful sign because the +LR has been shown to be as high as 8.6.

## Bottom line

Have a **low threshold** to perform a RUQ abdominal bedside ultrasonography for patients with upper abdominal pain or a fever from an unclear source (especially elder patients). Look for **indirect signs** of cholecystitis:

- Murphy sign
- Distended gallbladder
- Pericholecystic fluid
- Thickened gallbladder wall 
- Gallstones

## Fagan nomogram

Draw a connecting your pre-test probability and your likelihood ratio. This provides you with your post-test probability.
